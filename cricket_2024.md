The 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup is the ninth edition of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup. It is being co-hosted by the West Indies and the United States from 1 to 29 June 2024; the tournament being hosted by the West Indies for the second time, while this is also the first major ICC tournament to feature matches played in the United States.

The tournament field expanded from 16 to 20 teams, including the two hosts, the top eight teams from the 2022 edition, the best placed two teams in the ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings not already qualified, and eight other teams determined by regional qualifiers. Canada and Uganda qualified for the men's T20 World Cup for the first time, while the United States participated for the first time by virtue of being co-hosts.

Background
The ICC Men's T20 World Cup is a professional T20I tournament held between men's national cricket teams, organised by International Cricket Council (ICC). The tournament, now being held every two years, was first played in 2007 in South Africa. The last tournament held in 2022 in Australia was contested by 16 teams. The defending champions are England, who defeated Pakistan in the final.

Host selection
In November 2021, the ICC announced that the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup would be played in the United States and the West Indies.[4] A joint bid was submitted by Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket following two years of preparation, forming part of a strategic partnership between the two associations.[5]

USA Cricket's co-hosting was part of efforts to help develop and promote cricket in the United States, where the sport's largest fanbases are among South Asian Americans. Prior to this World Cup, the United States had occasionally hosted West Indies home matches at Central Broward Park in Florida, while a T20 franchise league known as Major League Cricket launched in 2023.

Despite, cricket having never become mainstream in the country, the United States is associated with several notable developments in the early history of the game, including having hosted Canada in the first international cricket match, and American cricketer Bart King having been credited with developing the technique of swing bowling

Format
The 20 qualifying teams were divided into four groups of five teams; the top two teams in each group advanced to the Super 8 stage. The advanced 8 teams were divided into two groups of four teams based on pre-tournament seedings; the top two teams in each group will advance to a four-team knockout stage. Prior to the tournament, the ICC announced the eight seeded teams for the Super 8 stage based on T20I rankings. If they advance from the group stage, they will be placed in pre-determined positions in the Super 8 stage, irrespective of their position in the group stage. If an unseeded team qualifies at the expense of a seeded team, they will take the position of the corresponding seeded team that failed to qualify from the group.

Schedule
On 28 July 2023, ICC announced that the tournament will be played from 4 to 30 June 2024. The revised schedule was announced on 5 January 2024, with the tournament scheduled to take place from 1 to 29 June. The teams will play 55 matches with three cities in the United States hosting 12 matches and the rest of the matches hosted by six venues in the Caribbean. On 16 May 2024, ICC announced that warm-up fixtures will be held from 27 May to 1 June.

Prize money
The ICC allocated a pool of $11.25 million in prize money for the tournament. The winners will earn at least $2.45 million, the highest prize money in the history of the tournament. In addition, each team will receive an additional $31,154 for each match they win excluding the semi-finals and final

Marketing
The ICC hosted a "trophy tour" before the tournament which began on 19 March in New York and the trophy was taken to various locations around the world. Former cricketers Yuvraj Singh, Chris Gayle, and Shahid Afridi and Olympian athlete Usain Bolt were named as the ambassadors of the tournament.
